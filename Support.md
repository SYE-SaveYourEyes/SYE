💬 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
❓ 1. Why aren’t my eye rest reminders working?
Please ensure notifications are enabled for SYE in your iPhone’s Settings → Notifications → SYE.
Also, verify that Screen Time and Family Controls permissions are granted under Settings → Screen Time → Content & Privacy Restrictions → App Limits.

❓ 2. My blocking feature isn’t working correctly.
Blocking requires Family Controls authorization.
Open the app → go to Settings → Permissions → tap Grant Screen Time Access and follow the system prompts.

❓ 3. How can I restore my premium subscription?
If you’ve previously purchased premium:
Open SYE → Settings → Premium
Tap Restore Purchases
Make sure you’re signed in with the same Apple ID used for the original purchase.

❓ 4. Can SYE improve my eyesight or replace medical advice?
No. SYE is not a medical application and does not diagnose, treat, or cure any vision or health condition.
It’s designed to support healthy screen habits, not replace professional medical advice.

❓ 5. I found a bug — how do I report it?
Please email us with:
A brief description of the issue

Your app version (found under Settings → About)
Send your report to support@saveyoureyes.app.

❓ 6. How do I delete my account or data?
Inside the app, go to:
Settings → Account → Delete Account
This permanently removes your data from our servers (Firestore) and your device.
